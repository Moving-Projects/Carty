      question: "How far in advance should I book my move?",
      answer: "We recommend booking your move at least 4-6 weeks in advance to ensure availability, especially during peak moving seasons. However, we understand that sometimes moves need to happen quickly, and weâ€™ll do our best to accommodate last-minute requests. Early booking allows us to better plan and allocate resources for your move."

      question: "How are moving costs determined?",
      answer: "Moving costs are based on several factors, including the distance of the move, the volume of items being moved, the level of service required (e.g., packing, unpacking), and any additional services requested.
